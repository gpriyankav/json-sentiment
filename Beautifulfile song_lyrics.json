"1 ContributorBeautiful LyricsThere is no truth in lying\nI can't cry without pain\nHappiness is a river we've been to\nWe all know that it's not the same\nBecause it's beautiful\n\nThere is no fun in knowing\nThere is more than just that\nSharpie marker on your arm and my face\nHands so close to not touching\nThat this embrace is beautiful\n\nAnd I won't smile\nIf I can't see\nThe understanding\nThe marvellous beauty\n\nAnd I won't die\nIf you say to me\nThat all of this beauty\nWill never be\nWill never be meant for meYou might also likeEmbed"
