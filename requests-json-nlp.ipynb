    "1. The Magician song by Andy Shauf reflects a relatively optimistic mood. Since the score is above 0.1, the words are upbeat.The lyrics express genuine concern for Angela by mentioning her mother and friends. Invoking warm feelings of family and friendship, expressions like \"write home to mom\" and \"tell us all your stories from far away\" are used.\n",
    "2. Justin Bieber song of Love Yourself has sentiment analysis of 0.1514 - The following lines found inside the song's lyrics: \"a little easier,\" \"fools,\" \"crowd watches his every move,\" \"death-defying feat,\" and \"look close, you'll see him sweat the most.\" These terms have no overtly negative connotations and could contribute to the creation of a more positive environment.The lyrics seem to mirror the steady development that comes with mastery, which is a theme that runs throughout the song. Observing this growth and progression could leave one with a sense of accomplishment and a desire to improve oneself.\n",
    "3. The song \"Alexander All Alone\" covers a wide range of emotions, which is reflected in its name. The neutral analysis of the song's mood possibly comes from the fact that it has both sad and happy parts.using terms and phrases that are commonly linked with sadness, such as \"alone,\" \"down,\" and \"tired.\" make sentiment analysis to -0.003."
