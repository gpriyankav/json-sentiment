"8 ContributorsAlexander All Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]\nAlexander all alone\nSmoking a cigarette\nThe last pack he'd ever buy\nAt least that's what he said\nHe stood up to stretch his back\nAnd fell down to the ground\n\n[Verse 2]\nAlexander all alone\nTill the neighbor caught a glimpse\nCried out for his wife\nTo call the ambulance\nAlexander all alone\nFelt them check his pulse\nHe heard them pronounce him dead\n\n[Chorus]\nHell is found inside of me\nAnd nothing else will set me free\nIf hell is found inside of me\nThen open me up and spill me out\n\n[Verse 3]\nAlexander wondered why\nNo life flashed before his eyes\nWhy his soul did not depart\nWhy he found no peace of mind\nWould it take a little while?\nWas it the same for everyone?\nAlexander realized\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThat hell is found inside of me\nAnd nothing else will set me free\nIf hell is found inside of me\nThen open me up and spill me outEmbed"
